1) Find targets and redshifts by location
    - Look at the endpoints available at /api/loc

2) Display spectra graphically
    - Look at endpoints avaiable at /gui/display

3) Find information on a list of provided targetIDs
    - Use /gui/multispectra to plot or get a .fits file of spectra

4) Get raw .fits file for a set of targetIDs
    - Use /api/multispectra

5) Perform general simple queries on single tables
    - Use endpoint /api/table to perform queries
    - Use endpoint /api/table/columns to get more information on a specific table
