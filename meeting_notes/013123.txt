MORE QUERY FIELDS:
limit redshift min/max

by predicted category (target: *._target (BIGINT)
	-Need research efficienty way to do bitwise search
by actual category (Zpix/Ztile: spectype/subtype)


DISPLAY:
histogram of redshifts based on query, etc

Go to other page for spectra based on healpix/tile/survey/night/etc
Might need to offer spectra by time, objects observed on multiple dates

ASTROdata query language (ADQL) -- extra generic query so researchers dont have to use our predefined query
