user provided list of columns (w/o knowing which table using targetid to connect tables)


diff healpix vs tile
if target on two diff tiles, one redshift combining tiles, and each individual tile

ADD option to getredshift by targetid based on healpix or tile 
	(also include which tile/survey/program or healpix/survery/program it was found at)

ADD option to getredshift from healpix based on bright vs dark (some overlap)

ADD option to get all measured redshifts, and SD, variance

programs(bright, dark -- also other like backup)


ADQL + TAP: very annoying to use, don't worry about TAP for now, maybe look into ADQL
