Table Hierarchy:

photometry
	subset + info: targets 
		subset + info: fiberassign
		   *
			zpix:
			ztile:


* tile / frame in between fiberassign and zpix/ztile

exposure: spectra



Unmaterialized views: 
- Ztile + fiberasssign + targets + photometry (Take everything)
- Zpix + fiberasssign + targets + photometry


TODO:
- Creating unmaterialized views that join tables (w/a columns)
- Generic access to columns in these views



Spectra is available at fuji favorited path
experiment with accessing spectra .fits
