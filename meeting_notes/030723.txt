targetid : DESI concept for each astronomical object
for photometry & target tables: each targetid has its own row (w/ all diff filters stacking into one row)


tile is single point of telescope (can overlap)
- Tile defined with targets, program, and survey based on reasons for observing (target bitmask (bright galazy, etc))
- same target can overlap with bright/dark program



given tile id one has one survey and program, so don;t need to do all
don't need frame info for now, just keep ztile
